## GUI

The **lii-gui** is another very useful tool that we can use to learn about Three.js as it allows us to quickly add a very basic user interface to interact with our 3d scene and the objects within it.

We can install the `lil-gui` from its official repository.


```bash
npm install lil-gui
```
